# Remote Buddy by IOSPIRIT

Flirc and [IOSPIRIT](https://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/) have teamed up to control your Mac on a whole new level - with new features that weren't possible before:

## Apple Remote wake-up support

When using an Apple Remote with Flirc USB and Remote Buddy 2, you can put your Mac to sleep - and then wake it up again through any, a single or multiple Apple Remote - depending on settings. Which is not just matching, but surpassing the capabilities of Apple's IR Receiver in this area.

## IR transmitter support

Flirc USB contains an IR transmitter that Remote Buddy 2 can use to send commands to other devices, such as TVs. At the time of writing, the IR transmitter of Flirc USB has a relatively short range of only a few centimeters. If the sensor of the device you want to control is not that close, a USB extension cable could be used to bring it into range.
