# Macros

Macros allow you to assign multiple functions to a single remote control press. For example, say you want to do one of the following;

- type a word on a single remote control button press
- Do a series of functions; CTRL+F2 and then Enter
- Press the volume up 4 times
- Navigate a menu with: Escape, go right three times, press enter twice

All these macros are now possible with firmware version v4.4.0. To get the latest firmware, download the latest GUI and you should be prompted of a new firmware version.

## Setting up Macros

There is currently no GUI support for macros yet. To set them up, please follow the appropriate commandline chapter.
