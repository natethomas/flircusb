# Inteset Remote Setup

Official support is coming for Inteset remote controls and Flirc. We are in engaged in a special partnership where the details will be revealed shortly.

In the mean time, Inteset remotes are currently supported and work well via the manual pairing method. We've also provided ready to go configurations for your convenience.

Add a device code that's not in your living room, like a Panasonic or Samsung TV codes to one of the remotesâ€™ top Device Code buttons (A, B, C, or D). Startup the graphical user interface, and pair with any of the supported profiles in the Flirc Pairing GUI as described Install our pairing application.

We do not recommend using any of the default profiles in the (A, B, C, D) device buttons. There are known issues with them; they do not have enough buttons and they will conflict with devices in your living room if present.

## NVIDIA Shield Inteset Setup Int-422-3

On current generations of Inteset remotes, it's very easy to add Nvidia Shield 2nd Generation. Here is the basic concept. We want to add a profile to your remote that does not exist in your room. I recommend either a Panasonic or Samsung TV.
If you have a Samsung TV in your room, we'll load the Panasonic profile to your remote. If you have neither TV then it makes no difference which profile you choose. The reason for this is that the profiles of these TVs have enough live buttons to provide the needed controls. It has nothing to do with the TV that you actually use. Follow the sections below:

### Don't have a Samusng TV in the same room?

Step 1: Select Device Code Profile A/B/C or D on your remote that you'd like to use to control Nvidia Shield.

Step 2: Hold down 'SET' on your Inteset remote until you see the LED blink twice

Step 3: Enter '12051' on your remote. On success, your LED will blink twice again.

Step 4: Start the Flirc Pairing Application

Step 5: ~~Load this configuration onto your device.~~ Not sure how to do this, follow [this guide](../Graphical%20User%20interface%20Guide/Restoring%20a%20Configuration.md).
