# Restoring a Configuration

Restoring a configuration is as easy as saving it. Under the file menu, head to Load Configuration. You will be prompted to select the previously saved file on your computer. The dialog will only let you load a valid configuration ending in **_fcfg** _extension.

If the file ends in fcfg, but is not valid, the Flirc GUI will know, and the file will not load.

You should see a progress bar under the Flirc Logo and loading should take a matter of seconds.
