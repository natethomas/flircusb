# Deleting a Pairing

In order to delete a button on flirc, the remote control button must have previously been paired.

Deleting a key can be done by pressing the erase button on the GUI. The Notification will prompt you to then press a button on your remote control that was previously paired. If the button wasn't previously paired, the GUI will let you know that nothing was deleted.
