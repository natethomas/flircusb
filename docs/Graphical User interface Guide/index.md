## How the FLIRC GUI Works

[Remember](../Introduction/index.md#how-flirc-works) flirc shows up to the device it's connected to as a keyboard, or HID device. The user interface presents pictures of different 'controllers'. These controllers hide the details. For example, to control Kodi, keyboard combinations are needed. Our Kodi controller will present an on screen display of Kodi controls. The Play key as an example shown below, is just a keyboard key 'P'. When pairing a remote control button with the 'play' button, on successive presses of this remote button will send the letter 'p' to the computer, in turn, playing the media on Kodi.

## Missing Keys on a Controller

If a controller is missing a key, not to worry. Since these are all keyboard keys, you can use the keyboard controller to pair any key, or combination of keys.
