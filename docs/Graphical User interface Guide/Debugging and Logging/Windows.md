# Windows

To enable logging on windows, find the installation directory:

`C:\Users\user> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\flirc"`


Edit the `flirc.ini` file with your favorite text editor, and make the following changes:

- Change loglevel = 0 to loglevel 5
- Change all the false words to true

The file should look like the following:

> NOTE - It is possible that windows will throw a permissions error not allowing you to write that file. To remedy this, temporarily drag Flirc.exe and flirc.ini to another location, like the desktop. Make the modifications there, and run Flirc.exe from your desktop. A log file should be placed on your desktop, and the flirc.ini and Flirc.exe can be moved back to the applications installation directory.
