There are a number of problems that can be caused for any particular setup, combination of setup, or particular remote. We'll work diligently helping should the correct fix not be documented in this manual.

Remember, there are various active discussions throughout the forums, help articles, and lastly, contact us if help is needed.

## Email Support

Remember, we are a small team. Please give us 24 hours to respond. If we don't respond, please send a gentle reminder.

## Phone Support

The phone number on the website is generally for sales inquires and partner type discussions. Because it's just me, phone support is technically impossible unless we schedule something on the phone, which is done frequently along with team viewer sessions. Any tech support needed, please email us through the [contact page](https://flirc.tv/pages/contact).
